# Specification of the Portable Issues and Pull Requests Format

## The problems

There are many providers of convenient Git user interfaces, often web-based, that allow users to create and manage issues and pull requests. Sometimes that interfaces are selfhosted, but often there are thirdparty platforms used. This causes a dependance on that platform. You can use many of them for a single project, because Git is designed as a decentral version controll system. But there is no convient way to share issues and pull requests between the platforms.

## The aims

This project aims to create a specification for a portable and easy to parse and modify format to store issues and pull requests within a Git repository. Furthermore libraries to use it in different programming languages and tools to use the format directly from command line should be created in the future. The long-term aim is to create a ecosystem for multi-platform issues and pull requests, which is integrated with every usually cooperative Git use case: The seamless share of issues and pull request between email based cooperation, command line based cooperation on non-public servers and the cooperation with web-based GUIs.
