# Directory structures

All issue and pull requests are stored within directories within the ```.portable``` directory directly in the top directory of your Git repository.

Within this directory there are up to three subdirectories: ```issues```, ```pull_requests``` and ```users```. Every subdirectory is optional. Note that the ```users``` directory is only useful if you have at least on of the two other directories.

## The directories
